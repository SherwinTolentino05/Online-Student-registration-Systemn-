    <div class="sub_title">
        The Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) is a government educational institution <br>
        governed by Republic Act Number 8292 known as the Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997, <br>
        and its Implementing Rules and Regulations contained in the Commission on Higher Education Memorandum <br>
        Circular No. 4, series 1997. PUP is one of the country's highly competent educational institutions.<br>
         The PUP Community is composed of the Board of Regents, University Officials, Administrative and Academic <br>
         Personnel, Students, various Organizations, and the Alumni.<br>  
        Governance of PUP is vested upon the Board of Regents, which exercises policy-making functions to carry <br>
        out the mission and programs of the University by virtue of RA 8292 granted by the Commission on Higher <br>
        Education. The University is administered by an appointed President by virtue of RA 8292 and is assisted<br>
         by an Executive Vice President and the Vice Presidents for Academic Affairs, Student Services, Administration,<br>
          Research, Extension and Development, and Finance.<br>
          Today, PUP is relishing its successes and its students are enjoying unprecedented academic opportunities,<br>
           an enhanced campus environment, upgraded colleges, state-of-the-art technology, and nationally and<br>
            internationally recognized programs.<br>
            PUP celebrated its centenary last October 2004. It has gone far from what it was more than a century ago.<br>
             This is mainly due to the support given by the government and the PUP Community and its benefactors. <br>
             With the combined effort, PUP will continue to be a partner in nation-building and in poverty<br>
              alleviation for the marginalized sector of society with quality, responsive, and relevant education <br>
              as a tool.<br><br>
